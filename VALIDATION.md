# Neon validation

[Back to Neon](README.md) · [Reproduce the browser workflow](docs/testnet.md) · [GitHub verification](https://github.com/agammann/neon/actions/workflows/verify.yml)

## Release decision

Neon is deployed publicly at [neon.alx21.chatgpt.site](https://neon.alx21.chatgpt.site) with Ethereum Mainnet trading enabled. **A real money mainnet validation transaction was intentionally skipped by the project owner.** That decision does not convert it into a completed test.

The recorded application release was Sites version 7, source commit [4c257db](https://github.com/agammann/neon/commit/4c257db17ea6a0137e32605fa6808358dd64233e). Its [GitHub verification run](https://github.com/agammann/neon/actions/runs/35177838151) succeeded. Documentation may advance independently of that unchanged application build.

## Recorded verification

Results below were recorded September 17, 2026 UTC, September 16 Pacific. Market quotes and balances are snapshots, not current prices.

| Area | Evidence and result |
| --- | --- |
| Automated suites | 25 passed, 0 failed: 23 offline tests and two contract fork integrations |
| Contract behavior | ETH / USDT swaps; signed partial and full fills; signature tampering, replay, cancellation, revoked approval, and expiry checks |
| Reorganization handling | Filled or cancelled orders recovered after simulated chain reversals; orphaned receipts suppressed |
| Fresh browser workflow | Seven successful local transactions; Alice received 2 USDT, Bob acquired and unwrapped 0.001 WETH |
| Browser failure handling | Rejected signature published nothing; stale cancelled fill rejected before submission; account change disabled actions |
| Permissions after cleanup | Both wallets had zero USDT and WETH allowances to 0x |
| Mainnet reads | Chain 1, expected contracts, signing domain match, zero 0x fee multiplier, and quotes in both directions |
| Published assets | Four JavaScript/CSS asset hashes matched the tested build; rendered interface checked separately |
| Dependency and CI checks | Production advisory check and the release GitHub workflow passed |

## Evidence files

| File | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [Release testnet](validation/release-testnet.json) | Latest seven transaction Alice and Bob browser scenario, balances, order state, and receipts |
| [Mainnet readiness](validation/mainnet-readiness.json) | Read only contract checks, code hashes, quotes, and timestamp; no transaction or signature |
| [Earlier swap testnet](validation/local-testnet.json) | Eight local browser transactions including swaps, USDT allowance reset, and revocation |
| [Earlier limit orders](validation/limit-orders-testnet.json) | Ten local browser transactions including sell and buy orders, partial fills, cancellation, and cleanup |
| [Earlier validation notes](docs/validation-history.md) | Historical implementation checks and their original scope |

Test wallets were disposable. Evidence files contain no private keys or session capabilities. The local testnet uses copied contract code and Ethereum state on chain 31337; it is not Sepolia or a real mainnet trade.

## Reproduce the checks

Run the [development commands](docs/development.md#commands) and follow the [browser walkthrough](docs/testnet.md). CI runs offline checks, rebuild verification, and production dependency auditing; main branch runs also execute the two fork suites and read only mainnet checks.

[Live readiness](https://neon.alx21.chatgpt.site/api/readiness) checks recent Ethereum data and settlement configuration. It returns HTTP 503 on failure. [Storage health](https://neon.alx21.chatgpt.site/api/health) checks storage separately. Neither endpoint certifies wallet compatibility, transaction execution, or safety.

## Verification boundaries

External wallet mainnet signing, hardware wallet combinations, and current mobile wallet compatibility remain unverified. Earlier simulator and instant swap layouts were checked at 390 pixels; the shared order interface was checked on desktop. No independent security audit is claimed.

One confirmation is not finality. History contains app indexed receipts rather than a complete chain index. An empty book needs user supplied orders and counterparties. Fork testing and mainnet read checks provide integration evidence without guaranteeing execution or safety under every production condition.
